- ✅ All files ready in `/dist` folder
- ✅ Vercel CLI installed and ready
- ✅ Configuration files created (vercel.json)
- ✅ All features working (search, reset progress, responsive design)

## 🔒 Deploy with Private Access - Step by Step

### STEP 1: Complete Vercel Login
You should see the Vercel login prompt in your terminal. Choose:
- **Continue with GitHub** (recommended)
- Or use your preferred authentication method

### STEP 2: Deploy to Vercel
After logging in, run:
```bash
cd "/Users/thamer/Downloads/agi-learning-platform"
vercel --prod
```

When prompted:
- **Set up and deploy?** → Yes
- **Which scope?** → Choose your account
- **Link to existing project?** → No
- **Project name** → `agi-learning-platform` (or your preferred name)
- **Directory** → `./` (current directory)
- **Override settings?** → No

### STEP 3: Add Private Access Protection

After deployment completes, you'll get a URL like:
`https://agi-learning-platform-abc123.vercel.app`

**To make it private:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project** → Click on it
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Click "Protection" in the sidebar**
5. **Enable "Password Protection"**
   - Set a strong password
   - Save changes

**Alternative: Vercel Authentication (more secure)**
- Instead of password protection, choose "Vercel Authentication"
- Invite specific users by email
- They'll log in with GitHub/Google

## 🎯 What You'll Get

2. **Click "Add New..." → Project**
